I am a  diploma student at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM majoring in information management and now it is my last semester in college, My hobby is reading. The book that i love to read is about religion. While reading about some religion books,, I was able to learn something new that i've never learn in school or universities. When the COVID-19 virus spread and Malaysians faced MCO 'Movement Control Order', I started learned to make business online.</p>
