    <p><strong> 2008: Sekolah Methodist (ACS) Lumut 
	<p><strong> 2008-2010: Sekolah Kebangsaan Pelabuhan Kuantan
	<p><strong> 2011-2013: Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai Petani 
<br>
<br>
	<p><strong> The reason why I have so many school to atend is because my father is my father was a member of the Royal Malaysian Navy. My father is also deployed to move almost every year because my Dad’s Unit as a diver is only available in Lumut And Kuantan. After my father retired, my family and I moved to Kedah. Throughout my schooling I was very active in sports. Almost all sports I enter including Football, Athletics, Cricket and even Softball. The sport with my highest achievement is Athletics where I represent the State of Kedah for MSSM</p>
<br>    
    <h3 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide"> Secondary School: </span></h3>
	<p><strong> 2014: Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Kulim
	<p><strong> 2014: Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Dato Jaafar Hassan
	<p><strong> 2014-2018: Sekolah Menengah Kebansaan Syed Hassan Sekolah Sukan Negeri Perlis
<br>
<br>
    <p><strong> I feel that I am a unique student because in the same year I went to three schools. This is because at first I went to school at SMK Kulim I played sports. After that I changed my intention to venture into football and I moved to SMK Dato Jaafar Hassan, Perlis. Less than two months after I went to school there, I finally got an offer to go to school at the state sports school, SMK Syed Hassan. Lots of bitter and sweet experiences throughout my schooling there. What is certain is that my life as an active student in sports to represent the State has given me a very proud feeling for myself.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide"> Universiti Teknologi Mara:  </span></h3>
    <p><strong>At first I didn’t want to continue studying because I just wanted to focus on my career as a football player since I already had a contract with the Perak Team. But due to school again my mom and dad pressured me to balance sports and academics, I had to comply. In 2019 I continued to study at Universiti Teknologi Mara Kedah and took up the field of Information Management. For me, life as an athlete and a student is very different. I could also see the character of an athlete and a student. Throughout my time at university I learned many new things. In terms of communication, how to make friends and so on. Being a student who at the same time being an athlete definitely helps me in self -confidence when facing in public. I am very happy to study at Uitm Kedah because there are many lecturers and I do not tire of giving guidance to myself who is deficient and also my friends who do not stop giving me the spirit to continue to study until the end of the semester.</p>
