			<h1><center><font color ="black">MY HAPPY FAMILY</h1></font>
  <marquee><h1 style="color:blue;">This is my lovely family. I'm grateful for having this family in my life. I have super mom and dad which will always support me. As being the eldest son, I'm responsible to take care of my family matters. Since I was child I have been taught to be independent, loving my siblings and appreciate each other. I have five siblings including me which are very meanigful for me. Sometimes we would fight but we will make peace again. That's we call LOVE. I hope that our ukhuwwah will be strong forever.  </h1></marquee></center>
